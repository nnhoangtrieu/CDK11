# CDK 11

A Python script to generate combinatorial molecular structures by connecting two molecules via single, double, or triple bonds between all possible atom pairs.

---

## Features
- Combine molecules from **SMILES strings** or files (`.txt`, `.smi`, `.sdf`).
- Generates all valid combinations with **single/double/triple bonds** between atom pairs.
- Outputs results to a timestamped file or custom directory.
- Automatically filters invalid structures (sanitization errors).
